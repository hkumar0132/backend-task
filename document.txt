Skipped:

1. Converting and pushing data to ./examples/users.csv [Reason: Time limit]
2. Converting and pushing data to ./examples/users.xml [Reason: Time limit]

I would have also considered adding the following:-

1. Implementing logic for promises[to write to files] seperately
2. Adding more comments
3. Segragating logic in separate files
